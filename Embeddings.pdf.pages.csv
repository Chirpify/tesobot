Page 4,"4When I moved here in 2007, Port land was a bo hemi an par adis eat the con ﬂu ence of culi nary ge nius, lus cious land scapes, and blind- ing op ti mis m. There was an ex cite men t and pas sion that was in fec- tious. The s tart up e cosys tem just s parked, the New York Times fuck- ing loved us, and we were the envy of the na tion. Com ing from Bos-ton, I had never even con sid ered va ca tion ing here, but after one vis-it, I was happy to call PDX my new home.Most ly, I was e n am ored with the cul ture. Peo ple were am bi- tious, kind, and at the top of their game. It was like the most tal ent- ed peo ple from every in dus try moved here to give each other thebest they had to offer. There was a streak of lib er tar i an is m tem peredwith lib er al kind ness, and every one was ac cept ing of every one’sweird ness. We even brand ed the city around it.Ex cit ed, I set about build ing a new life and a new busi ness. Iraised some cash, em ployed great peo ple, met life long friend s, andbe came one of the ﬁrst s tar tup s to build an of ﬁce space down town. Ibought a house in SE, drank stout s at Horse Brass, and took mydogs to Tabor every evening to bask in the gold en hour light. Thecity was pros per ous. It felt like a warm co coon where we could allmolt into what ev er we want ed to be come.By 2013 the city was grow ing very fast, and I could feel an in- ﬂec tion point was near. It was time for us to choose be tween growthand s tay ing weird. Was this the place to change the world, or was itwhere young peo ple go to re tire? Would we put on big boy pants orstick with the Kilt? Are we Ken’s Ar ti san or Pizza Jerk? Ok, that’s e- nough.Sadly, we chose to stay weird — a word that quick ly be came ape jo ra tive used to cover the crack s form ing in our foun da tion. Likea slow- motion de mo li tion, we went from a city of mo ti vat ed, ac cept- ing, and pas sion ate builder s to a bas tion of lazy anti- capitalist hyp- ocrites that can cel s any one who dis agrees with their ﬂa vor of moral- i ty.",609

Ride data sup plied by Trimet . Pop u la tion by U.S. Cen sus Bu- reau.In 2000, res i dents took 61 rides per capi ta per year, ac cord ing to Tri-Met’s data. Pret ty small.

I’d agree if the data showed in cre men tal progressthat was cor re lat ed with 13 bil lion dol lars of his tor i cal spend, butthat’s not the case.Peo ple vote every day for their pref er ence of trans porta tion,and de spite the trans porta tion bu reau’s war on cars that has dras ti- cal ly re duced speed s, e lim i nat ed lanes, and cre at ed bar ri er s that in- crease con ges tion, peo ple over whelm ing ly choose to drive.It’s time the city rec og nize the real rea son s why peo ple drive byun der stand ing why they don’t use other modes.

In re al i ty,only 2 peo ple died bik ing in 2017 and 2018. Trag ic, but 2! That’s un- de ni ably safe. For most peo ple, bik ing vs dri ving is more about ar- riv ing to your des ti na tion dry, not sweat ing, not car ry ing a bag,prox im i ty, they have kids, e quip men t, or are un able to do phys i calex er cise. They say peo ple don’t ride buses or the Max be causethey’re not u biq ui tous e nough. But it’s more about pri va cy, anx i ety,safe ty, re li a bil i ty, or not want i ng to sit next to a methed out psy cho.When the city asks for ever more tax money these psy cho log i cal nu- ances are con ve nient ly ig nored by the anti- car ad vo cates. But noamoun t of fund ing will change these rea son s, and they are all per- fect ly valid for want i ng or need ing a ve hi cle.These same ad vo cates claim they’re wag ing the war on cars tore duce e mis sion s. It’s a right eous war, but by mak ing traf ﬁc worseand com mute times longer, they’re ac tu al ly achiev ing the op po site.Idling cars cre ate more e mis sion s. Their coun ter point to this is “in- duced de mand” — less con ges tion would in crease the amoun t ofcars and wipe out the gains made by less idling. You can ﬁnd in tel li- gen t ar gu ments on both sides of in duced de mand, but just as wecan’t con vince peo ple to stop dri ving be cause there is too much traf- ﬁc, less traf ﬁc will not con vince more peo ple to drive.",700
Page 18,"18Ei ther way, no mat ter how painful you make it, the data overthe past 40 years is clear — you will not change be hav ior by leg isla- tive force.

Page 57,"57As we ap proached Hogs back the sun began to rise through thecloud s and s low ly il lu mi nate the moun tain. For the ﬁrst time I couldsee how high we’d gone.

Too windy for voice ac ti va tion. Even tu al ly my GoPro frozesolid.Here’s the view from 10,000 feet look ing back down the moun- tain.Right be fore Hogs back we stopped to leave our trek poles, pull outour ice axes, and rope up to one an oth er. I would be in the mid dlewith Aaron lead ing and Daryl be hind me. The s teep ness of theclimb at this point war rant ed the rop ing, and team work would beneed ed to keep safe dis tances be tween one an oth er so the ropeswould not slack too much. When one of us fell or s tart ed to slidedown the moun tain the oth er s would self ar rest, which ba si cal lymeans fall on your ice axe so it an chors you into the ice.Just above Hogs back it was time to de cide whether to reach forthe sum mit or turn back. Most sum mit at tempt s fail due to weath eror lack of ﬁt ness. I was still feel ing great, and Daryl gave the nod tosum mit as well. The weath er was get ting a bit can tan ker ous, but wethought we’d have time to get up and down be fore it got hangry.Aaron chose the Pearly Gates as the en try way to the sum mit vsthe Old Chute.

The winds had picked up to about 40mph, and ice pel let s were s tart ing to shwap our faces. We were ba si- cal ly yelling at each other Band of Broth er s style to push onthrough.

The re main der of the day would makethat seem easy.Shit Gets RealIt was time to start a 6,000 foot ver ti cal de scen t in white out con di- tion s, 60 mph winds, on ice, tied to each other. We would not knowthe way be cause the en tire moun tain s tart ed to look the same white.We would not see the crevass es, fumeroil s, cliff s, or cor nices. Wewould nav i gate blind by gps. We would bat tle ex haus tion, numb- ness, and -20° wind chill for the 5 hour de scen t — About twice aslong as it should have.The ﬁrst step was to de scend through The Old Chute, whichwas s light ly s teep er than the Pearly Gates. Here’s what it lookedlike to us…Halfway through the Old Chute the weath er got even worse. Icould n’t feel some ﬁn ger s which made ice axe han dling d if ﬁ cult.There was now a layer of ice over my en tire body. It was get ting re- al ly cold. The wind s tart ed to blow each one of us off our feet fair lyreg u lar ly. A dren a line was still high but it was burn ing en er gy fast.The de scen t on the ridge of the Hogs back was g narly.

We were still re al ly high though, and the weath er kept get tingworse.We de scend ed more and found our selves lost on an oth er ridge.Aaron ra diod down to the lodge and used GPS to try and ﬁx our lo- ca tion.

There would be no res cue at temp t frombelow in this weath er.Thank ful ly, we all s tayed cool. Aaron had a ton of ex pe ri ence nav i- gat ing the moun tain, and we just kept s low ly plod ding our waydown the moun tain until we were low e nough for the winds to diedown just e nough to be able to see some fa mil iar moun tain land- mark s.Sev er al painful hours later we ﬁ nal ly got back to Tim ber line.
