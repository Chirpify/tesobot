Small example, Oregon actually has a law stating every street corner is a crosswalk whether one is painted or not. This is the most dangerous of laws, and whoever wrote it should have their sanity checked.

It's dangerous to give one part of the country outsized influence over the rest, and abolition of the EC would do this far more than the current inequity. @GaryTheWanderer @BenClarkPhD @JeffMerkley Ok, lets simplify... If you abolish the EC then LA County's culture would be worth WAY more than Wyoming's culture currently is under the EC. It's not even close. @BenClarkPhD @JeffMerkley I said more equal. It treats cultural ideology more equal. And since culture is shared in a locality, abolition would go against the equality of ideology that you're actually advocating for. It would take the ideology of an LA County and apply it to the entire country. @BenClarkPhD @JeffMerkley Because ideology, values, and culture are not individual, they are shared and created by locality. Exactly why we have local electeds. EC is not perfect but it does make localities and their culture more equal. Thanks for the response, Ben. @JeffMerkley LA county has more people than 41 states. You're not concerned about the outsized influence this would create? If so, how would you solve for this? The party fracture will accelerate now, as insiders jump ship.

He's also revealed this opinion is based on his politics. Its discrediting. @jonst0kes I've been following him for some time. His thesis is that data is being purposefully manipulated.

Page 74,"@kissane We're so far behind that I think we should give up on number of infections as indicators for decisions, and rely on fatalities. https://t.co/7Aw4HU0ckg Leaders were caught pantless, and have been slow putting them on. We'll lead the globe in deaths because of it. Increasing signs of slowing will further embolden the eager to re-emerge. Data are immature for definitives, but there needs to be a plan for the plan. In addition to these, there are a lot of other factors and indicators to consider for a plan, but it is not my vocation, nor am I qualified, to make this plan. But I do know this: For our mental and economic sanity we need to re-emerge, and we won't wait for a vaccine. After confirming vars we need to know data on immunity and drugs. Some initial reports of low antibody production are very concerning. If we had at scale testing, and If we knew (of the recovered) who produced antibodies and why, we could decide who can emerge and when. Growing up in New England I know my peoples hate rules. In Oregon people form lines at the bar. Are those the only preconditions for mass fatalities? If so, amazing and sad to see diff mere days of anti-authoritarianism had on NYC vs LA. If not, we need to find other variables. Most important Qs imo: why are fatality growth rates slowing, and who will be safe to re-emerge? Most obvious slowing theory: Distancing works and virus has always been hyperlocal, killing most in dense populations of people slow to obey rules, or with underlying conditions. Without comprehensive testing, we have no idea the scale of infection. Until we do, number of cases is a useless indicator for re-emergence. Also, there's a non-zero chance we've nearly all been exposed, so even with large undercounts, the metric that matters most is deaths. With day over day fatality growth rate slowing, it's time we heard leadership's plan how society should re-emerge. In the absence of one, society will re-emerge on its own.

Page 90,"@trimethelp Thanks. Can you confirm that the row ""Avg. Wkd. Boarding Rides"" on https://t.co/Jn9QXrZT4J measures Average Weekday Boarding Rides, not weekend. @Andres4NY Biking in Portland is undeniably safe. 2 deaths per year in last 2 years. Many miles of dedicated bike lanes woven into the city from every neighborhood. It is viable, but not chosen. @Andres4NY Yes agreed, we have not spent as much on biking and transit as auto. Which makes sense given only a small fraction of people choose those modes, despite them being readily available viable options. @Andres4NY I was speaking about Portland not America as a whole. We have invested heavily here in both categories. @dmtrubman @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 It looks like you live in Philadelphia. In Portland there is viable transit and bike options, so there is a choice, but more and more people are choosing autos. I bike and drive, so this is not a bias. My argument is data driven. @evanmanvel @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 Yes, can't transform everything, but it has not transformed at all, and in fact transit ridership has decreased. I'm all for strategies that show progress, but this one has not. @dmtrubman @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 Driving is overwhelmingly more expensive than biking or transit, yet the data show people overwhelmingly choose to drive. @dmtrubman @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 Yes, I agreed we've financially subsidised autos because they still make the most sense for the most people. Again, what I said was driving and parking is not convenient everywhere, and especially not in portland. @Swarrick7 @sarahforpdx I don't think that's the case. I believe they care, just like you or I. We just disagree on strategy. @dmtrubman @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 Yes, we've spent way more on auto because autos make the most sense for the most people. We've made driving very inconvenient and people still overwhelmingly choose to do it vs other modes. More here https://t.co/B4DJJcSOgq @hannonizer @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor Thanks for sending. That is promising to see actual data from an American city making progress. Pedestrian data is super interesting there re: density. From what I've read they've not waged a war on cars legislatively like pdx. Even Hallenbeck has made statements about that. @hannonizer @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor Not quite. No long tail actual data. This was a survey, not actual ridership data from SDOT. Also, looks like the survey did not include ride-sharing like uber, and counted Zipcar as mass transit. I do like the employer incentives vs legislative pain to change behavior though! @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 Counterpoint is ‚Äúinduced demand‚Äù - less congestion increases cars and wipes out gains made by less idling. You can find intelligent arguments on both sides of induced demand, but just as we can‚Äôt convince peeps to stop driving b/c traffic, less traffic doesn't create more drivers @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 Also, combating emissions is the right fight, but the current war on cars is the wrong strategy. By making traffic worse and commute times longer, you're actually achieving the opposite desired result. Idling cars create more emissions. @sarahforpdx @Swarrick7 I'm sorry but (again) the data does not lie. We've invested massively in transit as well as biking for 40yrs and it has failed. Despite billions on planning,",828
Page 91,"infrastructure, and marketing, Trimet ridership is down 2% from 1980! Cars still make the most sense for the most people. @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor We should focus efforts there instead of wasting billions of dollars to cripple the one mode of transportation the overwhelming majority use. Again, it is economic incentives not economic pain that drive behavioral change at scale. @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor We can and will reduce emissions with electric and other non-petro based vehicles, and economic incentives for alternative forms of transportation that satisfy the previously discussed psychological nuances. @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor When the city asks for ever more tax money these psychological nuances are conveniently ignored by the anti-car advocates. But no amount of funding will change these reasons, and they are all perfectly valid for wanting or needing a vehicle. @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor For most people not biking is about arriving to your destination dry, not sweating, not carrying a bag, proximity, they have kids, equipment, or are unable to do physical exercise. The max is about about privacy, safety, reliability, or not wanting to sit next to a meth head. @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor I‚Äôm not demonizing bikes, trying to abolish mass transit, or advocating for increased emissions. I ride a bike and a motorcycle, so I'm not coming with transportation bias. There are very valid reasons the majority of people choose cars over alt forms every single day. @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor That is historical data from Portland, where we live, not projected data from a different culture. The fact is, you can't legislate behavioral change. It is economic incentives not economic pain that drive behavioral change at scale. It's time to end the war on cars. @gorgepulse @sarahforpdx @rand_raynor Advocates always point to Denmark because there isn't a single comparable in the U.S. The data does not lie. Despite enormous tax $ spent on alt forms of transportation over 40 years the number of cars has increased while the % of people choosing alternative forms has decreased. @jhooks Nice, haven't seen that episode yet but I've been loving Explained. https://t.co/ekq6Aj7ge2 @trimethelp Thank you for the response!

When I moved here in 2007, Portland was a bohemian paradise at the confluence of culinary genius, luscious landscapes, and blinding optimism. There was an excitement and passion that was infectious. The startup ecosystem just sparked, the New York Times fucking loved us, and we were the envy of the nation. Coming from Boston, I had never even considered vacationing here, but after one visit, I was happy to call PDX my new home. Mostly, I was enamored with the culture. People were ambitious, kind, and at the top of their game. It was like the most talented people from every industry moved here to give each other the best they had to offer. There was a streak of libertarianism tempered with liberal kindness, and everyone was accepting of everyone‚Äôs weirdness. We even branded the city around it. Excited, I set about building a new life and a new business. I raised some cash, employed great people, met lifelong friends, and became one of the first startups to build an office space downtown. I bought a house in SE, drank stouts at Horse Brass, and took my dogs to Tabor every evening to bask in the golden hour light. The city was prosperous. It felt like a warm cocoon where we could all molt into whatever we wanted to become. By 2013 the city was growing very fast, and I could feel an inflection point was near. It was time for us to choose between growth and staying weird. Was this the place to change the world, or was it where young people go to retire? Would we put on big boy pants or stick with the Kilt? Are we Ken‚Äôs Artisan or Pizza Jerk? Ok, that‚Äôs enough. Sadly, we chose to stay weird ‚Äî a word that quickly became a pejorative used to cover the cracks forming in our foundation. Like a slow-motion demolition, we went from a city of motivated, accepting, and passionate builders to a bastion of lazy anti-capitalist hypocrites that cancels anyone who disagrees with their flavor of morality. The startup ecosystem never got the capital it needed. The homeless never got the mental and addiction services they needed. Small businesses never got the incentives they needed. Portland got the leaders they wanted, but not the ones we needed. And the city that promised to accept everyone? Well, it only accepts the ideologues. We‚Äôve mistaken progressivism for progress, compassion for enablement, speed limits for safety, taxation for prosperity, and woke for reason. Too harsh? We‚Äôre not alone in this deterioration, but we are the shining example. Cities die when their tax base departs, and the smart money has already left. The steady in-flow of Californians provides a stop-gap, but there‚Äôs a real sadness in the air‚Äîa defeatist malaise. I don‚Äôt think this turns around in any personally acceptable length of time. In fact, I believe the worst is yet to come. And for that reason, I‚Äôm out.",835
Page 135,"My criticisms of Portland are well documented , so I‚Äôm not going to roast it further. I‚Äôm the cynic that needs to leave, so I‚Äôve come to say goodbye. I was fortunate to live an extraordinary life here. Fortunate to have become close with many incredible people. Fortunate to meet my wife and have our first child here. Fortunate to sell my house and my business. Fortunate to be in a position to leave. I‚Äôm leaving Portland. In fact, I‚Äôm leaving Oregon. We still own a business in Portland and have family that lives there, so I‚Äôm not going too far. The landscape is still luscious, and PNW is still one of the best places in the country to live. I just want more space and less drama. Oh, and to raise animals. Consequently, I‚Äôve bought 10 acres to build a home and farm. See you on the ranch.

Page 138,"My east coast homies, and the rest of the country want to know what‚Äôs up with Portland. They heard the entire city is on fire, and anarchy is on the march to their hometown. They think the crowd is 100% unemployed white kids destroying shit for no good reason, hijacking BLM. Truth is, there's a good deal of that. Also there‚Äôs vets, moms, teachers, my neighbors, and every single other identity that make up this city. Each have their reasons for being in the mix. Income inequality , BLM, feds and fascism, unemployment, pandemic panic, general youth angst, mental illness , government lies and ineffectuality. There‚Äôs much to be angry about. Many are marching to seek change, while some stay into the wee hours to burn this mother down. The distinction between rioter and protester have people choosing sides in yet another issue they‚Äôve deemed black and white . They ignore nuance. They see no gray. The media loves the divide. As the Dark Side says, ‚ÄúLet the hate flow through you. Give in to your anger. Click on our link!‚Äù. But as usual, the gray is the biggest part. I hate watching isolated small portions of my city destroyed, just as much as the country dislikes watching it on CNN. But I see the gray. As much as I dislike the rioter‚Äôs tactics, they‚Äôre a necessary component in the broader spectrum of the movement. We need extremes to move the needle, and that needle has been stationary far too long. This isn‚Äôt to say police shouldn‚Äôt keep riots at bay, or swiftly end violent factions within the movement. Everything in its right place. This isn‚Äôt a partisan thing. You need extremes on both sides. I hate right-wing militia tactics, but they help move the needle to keep neoliberal government from getting too big. Too much extremism is too much, but the gray keeps that in check too. Whether you like it or not, we are actually all in this together. Embrace the gray, there is good in the gray. Salvatore entered the world at 12:50 on a Friday morning, in a hospital room, in the middle of a global pandemic. He‚Äôs one of the first Coronials‚Ñ¢, a generation that will grow up learning from parents of the unique, sad, and chaotic time in which they arrived. For two trimesters we had planned for a home birth, but the world banned plans a bit ago. Emily‚Äôs water broke two weeks early. Contractions started, but didn‚Äôt progress fast enough. After waiting 72 hours for them to pick up, we made the difficult decision to head into the hospital to induce before sepsis could dig in. Being in a hospital with a pregnant partner right now is like being in an episode of Walking Dead, only actually terrifying. People in hazmat stopped us out front and recorded our temperatures with what looked like a tricorder. Guards stopped us at the next checkpoint. People asked questions like ‚Äúhave you travelled to the following locations in the last week?‚Äù. Entire wings, hallways, and rooms were taped off. Getting into the labor and delivery ward felt like we had achieved secret clearance. Sick people walking the hallways looked genuinely scared. Emily was in labor for 27 hours and recovery for 15. She‚Äôs was beyond amazing going through this experience with poise and strength, especially when the experience was the opposite of her plan. The entire time we didn‚Äôt leave the room, but many people came and went. Doctors, nurses, food delivery, cleaning crews, and more. Not a single person wore a mask, or any PPE. Not ONE. When I asked why they simply responded that there was none. No protective gear for the people tasked with healing the most infectious people in the most infectious building in the middle of a pandemic. Got it.",822
Page 139,"I was so thankful to not live in NY or other cities that have banned partners from attending births, but all I could think of while being in there was how can I get us the fuck out and get my firstborn home safe without any of us contracting the virus. With each new person entering our room I grew ever more impatient. We pressured them into letting us leave the same day Emily had Sal. Walking out under supervision through the entire hospital to get to the only exit they‚Äôve left open was surreal. We‚Äôre home, safe, and asymptomatic for now. I‚Äôve been enraged about the coming wave of deaths, and our government‚Äôs slow reactive response to the pandemic for a while. The math has been on the chalkboard for some time, and I was an early preacher. I won‚Äôt rehash that here, you can read the tweets. I ride a bike and a motorcycle, drive a jeep, run many miles weekly, and am a pedestrian. I have no transportation bias. I‚Äôm here to say we need cars, and Portland should end the war on them. For reasons I don‚Äôt understand, this topic is very emotional for a lot of people, and they express this by demonizing drivers. The debate for me is statistical, not emotional. Driving still makes the most sense for the most people. Despite the enormous amount of tax dollars spent on planning, building infrastructure, and marketing alternative forms of transportation, the number of cars on Portland roads has increased while the percentage of people choosing an alternative has decreased. Ride data supplied by Trimet . Population by U.S. Census Bureau. In 2000, residents took 61 rides per capita per year, according to TriMet‚Äôs data. Pretty small. Since then, as the population served by TriMet surged nearly 30%, the region spent more than $13 billion in development and subsidized high-density, mixed-use housing projects in light-rail and other transit corridors. The results? In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, residents took just 56 rides per capita per year, a drop of 8%. Even smaller. As in most other cities, Portland transit ridership percentage is declining while the number of registered cars is rising. The experiment has failed. However, Metro, the regional government for the Portland area, the city‚Äôs leaders and transportation bureau continue to propose a familiar solution to this: levy taxes, and make it more painful to drive. Advocates claim the mass transit experiment is failing because we‚Äôre actually not spending enough. I‚Äôd agree if the data showed incremental progress that was correlated with 13 billion dollars of historical spend, but that‚Äôs not the case. People vote every day for their preference of transportation, and despite the transportation bureau‚Äôs war on cars that has drastically reduced speeds, eliminated lanes, and created barriers that increase congestion, people overwhelmingly choose to drive. It‚Äôs time the city recognize the real reasons why people drive by understanding why they don‚Äôt use other modes. Bike advocates say people don‚Äôt bike because it‚Äôs unsafe. They believe enough safety funding will surely convince everyone to peddle to work. In reality, only 2 people died biking in 2017 and 2018. Tragic, but 2! That‚Äôs undeniably safe. For most people, biking vs driving is more about arriving to your destination dry, not sweating, not carrying a bag, proximity, they have kids, equipment, or are unable to do physical exercise. They say people don‚Äôt ride buses or the Max because they‚Äôre not ubiquitous enough. But it‚Äôs more about privacy, anxiety, safety, reliability, or not wanting to sit next to a methed out psycho. When the city asks for ever more tax money these psychological nuances are conveniently ignored by the anti-car advocates. But no amount of funding will change these reasons, and they are all perfectly valid for wanting or needing a vehicle.",822
Page 140,"These same advocates claim they‚Äôre waging the war on cars to reduce emissions. It‚Äôs a righteous war, but by making traffic worse and commute times longer, they‚Äôre actually achieving the opposite. Idling cars create more emissions. Their counterpoint to this is ‚Äúinduced demand‚Äù ‚Äî less congestion would increase the amount of cars and wipe out the gains made by less idling. You can find intelligent arguments on both sides of induced demand, but just as we can‚Äôt convince people to stop driving because there is too much traffic, less traffic will not convince more people to drive. Either way, no matter how painful you make it, the data over the past 40 years is clear ‚Äî you will not change behavior by legislative force. Given this, it‚Äôs time to recognize the war on cars is not only a waste of money, but may be irresponsibly worse for the environment and the economy, and adds stress to the majority of people on a daily basis. Again, don‚Äôt get emo about this. I‚Äôm not demonizing bikes, trying to abolish mass transit, or advocating for increased emissions. We can and will reduce emissions with electric and other non-petro based vehicles, and economic incentives for alternative forms of transportation that satisfy the previously discussed psychological nuances. We should focus efforts on incentives instead of spending billions of dollars to cripple the one mode of transportation the overwhelming majority use. It is economic incentives ‚Äî not economic pain ‚Äî that drive behavioral change at scale. A common sense view of well intentioned transportation laws There has been much discussion in Portland about Vision Zero ‚Äî an initiative by the city to make roads safer. The intention is spot on, but governmental understanding of the psychology of road use is dead wrong. Vision Zero will fail. There are many micro-reasons why accidents occur in Pdx. Most can be summed up as: Neighborhoods are dense, and Portland is the home to many varying forms of transportation, including but not limited to: angry emo bicyclists, overly confident pedestrians, stoned indecisive drivers, road hogging buses, ‚Äútoo old to be skateboarding‚Äù skateboarders, motorcyclists, and flame throwing bagpiping unicyclists. Also, there‚Äôs sometimes naked people. Side note on this, but when weird is on stage, it‚Äôs no longer weird, it‚Äôs an act, Portland. For the record, I ride a motorcycle as well as a bicycle, drive a jeep, and am bipedal. So, I have no transportation bias or agenda. Reasonable people argue that it‚Äôs futile to attempt to have all of these forms of transportation coexist safely. I‚Äôm one of them ‚Äî in favor of more segregation, opposed to inclusion. I agree with @ Pdxcantdrive . Bike roads should contain bikes, and car roads cars. But then again, I also want to eliminate most all road laws and signs, so there‚Äôs that. But it‚Äôs not that simple, and these solutions are not obtainable. The problem is a fundamental flaw in Portland‚Äôs understanding of road psychology ‚Äî how our roads are actually used. Not how they should be used. Like most of my views on other issues, I think common sense law and deregulation tend to work best. Building more speed bumps and",697
Page 141,"lowering the speed limit to human running speed are band aids. It‚Äôs treating the symptoms, not the problem. Often these treatments create other problems ‚Äì Feeling the traffic lately? Applying common sense law to road rules, I ask a simple question‚Ä¶ In a car vs pedestrian collision who wins? Fact: when you play car vs anything, the car generally always wins. Why then would we ever write a law that gives anything other than a car the right of way? Emboldening pedestrians, bikers, motorcyclists, or any other form of transportation in a weaker position than a car is a mistake. It leads to the poor decisions that lead to accidents. Living on Division St., one of the roads targeted by Vision Zero for ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù, I‚Äôve seen the following scenario unfold multiple times: A pedestrian confidently struts across the street only to be t-boned by an automobile going 30mph. Logically, a person should never step out in traffic. But he boldly walked right out into oncoming traffic because he had the confidence of the law behind him. He‚Äôd been told it is his right of way. And it‚Äôs not just painted crosswalks. Oregon actually has a law stating every street corner is a crosswalk whether one is painted or not. This is the most dangerous of laws, and whoever wrote it into existence should have their sanity checked. Other scenarios unfold in similar fashion. Portland has gone to great lengths to give bicyclists power. Again, good intention, bad execution. Some bike laws are as insane as telling pedestrians to walk out in front of an oncoming car. We‚Äôve actually told bikers that cars will come to a full stop and wait for them to pass on the right before they turn right! Does it not make more sense for the pedestrian to wait for the car to pass? For the biker to wait for the car to turn? As a reminder, cars outweigh people. Know what happens to pedestrians in Boston that step off the curb when it‚Äôs not their turn? No, you don‚Äôt, because it doesn‚Äôt happen. People there know better than to step in front of a moving vehicle because the drivers there don‚Äôt obey the law. Pedestrians have been conditioned by their environment that they will die an awful public death. Again, this is not an argument of how drivers should behave. This is a common sense view of how they do behave. Making streets safer is a worthy idea, but all the speed bumps in the world won‚Äôt make a difference if people continue to be emboldened by illogical laws that give them a false sense of security. It‚Äôs survival of the fittest out there. It‚Äôs time our road rules were informed by the laws of natural selection. Give cars the right of way in all instances. They are bulls in a china shop. I marched in PDX today. It was amazing to see so many people stand up across the world. I was glad to be a small part of it, and proud to march once again with my activist parents. My mom pictured above. I marched not only to protest Trump and the social inequity he represents, but also Clinton and Obama, and all other leaders of our two party plutocracy. Plutocrats don‚Äôt care which party is in power, because the two party system works for them. We spend our days carrying out the plutocrat‚Äôs marketing plan ‚Äî partisanship. Divide the populace, and keep them distracted, endlessly bickering symptoms so they‚Äôll look past the disease. This",751
Page 142,"strategy has worked for my entire life. Take one scroll through Facebook or Twitter and it seems to actually be getting more effective. At best, Trump‚Äôs a bigot, a phony, and a dangerous narcissist. Income inequality grew more under Obama than any other leader in history, pillaging the poor and raping the middle class. Both Clintons are corrupt. Bill specifically signed NAFTA, gutted welfare, exploded the prison population, deregulated the media and the banks, and sexually assaulted multiple women. Bush, a scared simpleton warmonger. Reagan ignored Aids for profit. List ad infinitum. Each one with different unforgivable faults no leader should have, but all with one thing in common ‚Äî They‚Äôre actors in a play written by the wealthy. We‚Äôre so easily corralled into two stalls, force fed the only two shitty options on the menu. We accept it, never seriously contemplating third or fourth options, dismissing them as extremist or crazy. It‚Äôs time to stop participating in the marketing plan and end the hyperbolic partisan social media rhetoric that has you believing our differences are insurmountable. We‚Äôre a lot more alike than we are different. We should come together to start looking/creating/expanding our political options, because the two we‚Äôve been hiring don‚Äôt work for us. Stop bickering about the actors. Start holding the writers accountable. And for fucks sake, get the money out of politics, and expand your options. In 2011, Chirpify was born. We invented conversational commerce, enabling people to pay each other, and buy things, with a single comment across Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. It started as a P2P payments mechanism ‚Äî A way for people to send money to each other, simply by tweeting at them, and evolved into a full end-to-end marketing automation and engagement loyalty platform used by global brands and millions of people. We have confused compassion with enablement. The state of homelessness in Portland, as with most west coast cities, is a well-documented disaster for all involved. The response by the city, or lack thereof, is inhumane at best, and perhaps criminal at worst. We should house every single person and make it impossible to sleep on the street. This topic is fraught with emotional arguments from both sides, even with each agreeing on the goal ‚Äî to provide all people a safe place to sleep along with mental and addiction services, while keeping our city safe and clean. As usual the disagreement lies in the strategy to get there. Let‚Äôs start with the current actions, or lack thereof, taken by the city to address the crisis. In 2018 I met with Mayor Wheeler and his team along with other entrepreneurs and business owners with offices located downtown. I asked ‚ÄúHow many homeless are there and what is the total cost estimate to house them?‚Äù. The latter end of that question is the difficult part, but I was surprised they didn‚Äôt know the answer to the first. Their methodology to gather data is to survey homeless people that happen to show up to a shelter one day a year on a single night in January . In other words, they not only have a lack of strategy, but a lack of data on which to base one. As a result, I left feeling any solutions presented can‚Äôt be taken seriously. While this experience was anecdotal, I believe it is a microcosm of the inaction on real solutions. Smart",721
Page 143,"folks on both sides say inaction is due to the gridlock of opposing political forces. If so, the problem also seems to be a lack of courage. Despite the absence of data, we fund programs attempting to address the issue. In 2019 the city budgeted $31 million , the majority of which was spent on affordable housing. Metro is currently weighing a tax measure as large as $300 million a year without releasing a plan on how they‚Äôd spend it. We spend $4.5 million per year on homeless camp cleanups , even though only 15% of the sites were actually cleaned. We spent the marijuana tax on Vision Zero instead of on mental and addiction services as promised. On the policy side, we‚Äôve made it ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and legal to set up tents and sleep on city streets, and we continue to debate the legality. We‚Äôve crafted proposals that want to buy people their own home . We‚Äôre even weighing policy that would force contractors to build areas for homeless to camp in newly constructed buildings. Finally, we continue to build temporary shelters located within the temptations of city streets. Without proper data It‚Äôs difficult to know if $31 million or $300 million is a sufficient amount of funding, but one drive around Portland is enough to know that the effort is either underfunded or misappropriated. My hunch is the latter. While affordable housing is important in aiding people on the brink of homelessness stay housed, it does nothing to house the homeless who are unable to afford ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù housing, are addicted to substances that prohibit them from staying housed, suffer from mental illnesses that handicap their ability to care for themselves much less a home, or those who actually prefer the ease and accessibility to substances and relative lawlessness living on city streets provides. These vulnerable people need housing, but they need it to be free, and they need it simultaneous with mental and addiction services. So, why don‚Äôt we provide that? First and foremost, we should collect ongoing comprehensive data on who is homeless and why. The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù in the data is not to be understated. Without comprehensive data that outlines in aggregate, as well as per person, the reason they‚Äôre homeless it‚Äôs too easy for us to make up our own story about the causes of the epidemic. Second, we should consolidate services under a single agency for accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Third, we should build or buy a housing facility outside the city large enough to house all homeless based on the data collected. I say outside the city because It‚Äôs important to relocate people away from the opportunities, temptation and ease city streets afford. This facility would provide housing and food, along with mental and addiction services for free. These services should be intensive, mandatory, and available at the same location where people are housed. I would not make sobriety mandatory, as this is one of the main reasons homeless people avoid shelters and services that require it. Finally, we should make it impossible to sleep on the streets of Portland. Those who return to do so will be transported back to free housing and services. Admittedly, I have no idea how much this proposal would cost to implement, but that‚Äôs the point. Put forth a plan before proposing arbitrary budgets that take more of our citizen‚Äôs hard earned income. Land and facilities outside the city are far less expensive, we can reallocate funds from camp cleanups to relocation transport, and the consolidation of services will reduce waste. More salient, I can‚Äôt imagine the cost could outweigh the economic impact homelessness has on tourism, retail, hospitality, healthcare, transit, and other ancillary metropolitan systems, so there should be private and public revenue streams from which to draw. Homeless advocates will say the houseless will be uprooted, discriminated against, or traumatized by this proposal. Some will claim it‚Äôs their right to sleep on the street. But it‚Äôs not",822
Page 144,"compassionate to advocate for people to sleep on the street, and it is inhumane to enable homelessness. It‚Äôs August 18th, and I‚Äôm leaving Portland. When I moved here in 2007, Portland was a bohemian paradise at the confluence of culinary genius, luscious landscapes, and blinding optimism. There was an excitement and passion that was infectious. The startup ecosystem just sparked, the New York Times fucking loved us, and we were the envy of the nation. Coming from Boston, I had never even considered vacationing here, but after one visit, I was happy to call PDX my new home. Mostly, I was enamored with the culture. People were ambitious, kind, and at the top of their game. It was like the most talented people from every industry moved here to give each other the best they had to offer. There was a streak of libertarianism tempered with liberal kindness, and everyone was accepting of everyone‚Äôs weirdness. We even branded the city around it. Excited, I set about building a new life and a new business. I raised some cash, employed great people, met lifelong friends, and became one of the first startups to build an office space downtown. I bought a house in SE, drank stouts at Horse Brass, and took my dogs to Tabor every evening to bask in the golden hour light. The city was prosperous. It felt like a warm cocoon where we could all molt into whatever we wanted to become. By 2013 the city was growing very fast, and I could feel an inflection point was near. It was time for us to choose between growth and staying weird. Was this the place to change the world, or was it where young people go to retire? Would we put on big boy pants or stick with the Kilt? Are we Ken‚Äôs Artisan or Pizza Jerk? Ok, that‚Äôs enough. Sadly, we chose to stay weird ‚Äî a word that quickly became a pejorative used to cover the cracks forming in our foundation. Like a slow-motion demolition, we went from a city of motivated, accepting, and passionate builders to a bastion of lazy anti-capitalist hypocrites that cancels anyone who disagrees with their flavor of morality. The startup ecosystem never got the capital it needed. The homeless never got the mental and addiction services they needed. Small businesses never got the incentives they needed. Portland got the leaders they wanted, but not the ones we needed. And the city that promised to accept everyone? Well, it only accepts the ideologues. We‚Äôve mistaken progressivism for progress, compassion for enablement, speed limits for safety, taxation for prosperity, and woke for reason. Too harsh? We‚Äôre not alone in this deterioration, but we are the shining example. Cities die when their tax base departs, and the smart money has already left. The steady in-flow of Californians provides a stop-gap, but there‚Äôs a real sadness in the air‚Äîa defeatist malaise. I don‚Äôt think this turns around in any personally acceptable length of time. In fact, I believe the worst is yet to come. And for that reason, I‚Äôm out. My criticisms of Portland are well documented , so I‚Äôm not going to roast it further. I‚Äôm the cynic that needs to leave, so I‚Äôve come to say goodbye. I was fortunate to live an extraordinary life here. Fortunate to have become close with many incredible people. Fortunate to meet my wife and have our first child here. Fortunate to sell my house and my business. Fortunate to be in a position to leave. I‚Äôm leaving Portland. In fact, I‚Äôm leaving Oregon. We still own a business in Portland and have family that lives there, so I‚Äôm not going too far. The landscape is still luscious, and PNW is still",823
